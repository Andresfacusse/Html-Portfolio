<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiast for creativity and design. I graduated from Industrial engineering and have worked since I graduated
   in my family business: Textiles. Moving product in my small country trying to sustain the dying industry of tailoring. 
   In addition, we also make uniforms, so my job was to standarize a workflow where being non-standard was our selling point! </p>

<p>I only know the basics of sewing, but my in combination with analytical skills and what I was taught at University:
  I have managed to improve operations, both within sales and production departments, with an organized workflow. And that 
  is what I have done in a nutshell. I analyze problems/projects/obstacles and find cost effective, long lasting, quality 
  solutions that tackle the problem. I also am a great enthusiast in keeping statistics to track
  your success/failure record and detect problems on the go. 
</p>

<p>For the past years I have been exploring different areas of different industries, accessing technology that is beyond my 3rd world country.
  My engineering degree introduced me to CAD technologies, which eventually led me to learning presicion engineering via solidworks, and more informal work
  through Blender. 
</p>

<p>To summarize: I am a geek and a nerd, who loves to work in an organized manner, I am trilingual with native English and Spanish, advanced German aswell. I am an aspiring game developer as well as an Engineer, Entrepeneur, Creator and now recently: a web Developer.
  If you need creativity, ingenuity and skills: search no more.
